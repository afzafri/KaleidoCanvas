# KaleidoCanvas
KaleidoCanvas is an interactive digital art project where users create unique, kaleidoscopic artwork by answering simple questions. Each response shapes the design, resulting in a personalized abstract piece with dynamic symmetry and vibrant colors.

## Tech Stack
- **p5.js**: A JavaScript library that makes it easy to create and manipulate graphics and interactive content.
- **LocalStorage**: Used to store user data and shape data for a personalized experience.

## Design Philosophy: Neumorphism

KaleidoCanvas employs a design style known as Neumorphism, which blends the concepts of skeuomorphism and flat design. Neumorphism creates a soft, extruded plastic look, giving the interface a tactile and almost 3D appearance. This is achieved through the use of subtle shadows and highlights, which simulate the way light interacts with surfaces in the real world.
